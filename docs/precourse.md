## UNIX

As is stated in the course prerequisites at the [announcement web page](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/2021-03-longreads), we expect participants to have a basic understanding of working with the command line on UNIX-based systems. You can test your UNIX skills with a quiz [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2BEWeOKLbIRGBT_aDEGPce1FOaVYBbhBiaqcaHoBKNB27MQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). If you don't have experience with UNIX command line, or if you're unsure whether you meet the prerequisites, follow our [online UNIX tutorial](https://edu.sib.swiss/pluginfile.php/2878/mod_resource/content/4/couselab-html/content.html).

## Software

We will be mainly working on an Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/]))  Elastic Cloud (EC2) server. Our Ubuntu server behaves like a 'normal' remote server, and can be approached through a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). All participants will be granted access to a personal workspace to be used during the course.

The only software you need to install before the course is [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/).
