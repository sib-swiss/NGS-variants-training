## UNIX

As is stated in the course prerequisites at the [announcement web page](https://www.sib.swiss/training/course/20220915_NGSGV), we expect participants to have a basic understanding of working with the command line on UNIX-based systems. You can test your UNIX skills with a quiz [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2BEWeOKLbIRGBT_aDEGPce1FOaVYBbhBiaqcaHoBKNB27MQ/viewform?usp=sf_link). If you don't have experience with UNIX command line, or if you're unsure whether you meet the prerequisites, follow our [online UNIX tutorial](https://edu.sib.swiss/pluginfile.php/2878/mod_resource/content/4/couselab-html/content.html).

## Software

We will be mainly working on an Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/]))  Elastic Cloud (EC2) server. Our Ubuntu server behaves like a 'normal' remote server, and can be approached through a [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) web interface. All participants will be granted access to a personal workspace to be used during the course. The web interface will be approached through http (not https!), so make sure you can access http sites. You can validate it here: [http://httpforever.com/](http://httpforever.com/).

The only software you need to install before the course is [Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/).

!!! info "For self-learners"
    Self learners can install the required software via conda, or run the VS code web interface inside a container. More instructions at [Setup](day1/server_login.md)
